## Demonstration

## Goal
During the lifetime of garrysmod many weapon bases consisting of poor quality were created, and it would be a shame to see the same in S&box. The goal is to offer an easy to use yet very configurable weapon base maintained by the community for the community.

## Features

### Various
* No programming skills needed to use
* Highly configurable
* Support for custom animations and actions

### Attachment Editor ([Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BgAXlzTlCU))
The `swb_editor_attachment` command opens an attachment editor that can be used to easily calculate offsets needed for the view and worldmodel.

### Model Editor ([Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAYmOp3oJOE))
The `swb_editor_model` command opens a model editor that can be used to easily calculate offsets needed for running, zooming, and more.

### Built-in Animations
* Walking
* Crouching
* Running
* Jumping
* Idle
* Sway
* Zooming

### Built-in HUD
* Modular Health Display
* Modular Ammo Display
* Dynamic Crosshair
* Dynamic Hitmarkers

### Bases
* Magazine (default)
* Shotgun (shell based reloading)
* Sniper (scoped zooming)
* Entity (grenades, arrows, props, ...)
* Melee

### Attachments
* Customization menu (`q`)
* Categorized
* Localization
* Stat modifiers
* Easy to add

### Weapon Models
* Properly licensed weapon models are included in the base
* They can be used for any purpose as long as the license is respected (credits.txt)

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute by creating a pull request to their branch. Contributors can help out with the planned updates, outstanding bug/issues, or maybe you just have a cool idea that would improve the base, any help is welcome!

## Planned Updates
* More base-included entities (e.g. bomb)
* More attachments
* Physical bullets
* Worldmodel clipping shader

## Deathmatch Elements
For now some deathmatch dependencies are included as the base uses the inventory and hud elements from the deathmatch gamemode.

## Installing
If you want to test out the base just drag and drop simple-weapon-base-master into your addons folder.
